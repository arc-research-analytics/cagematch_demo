# Lunch & Learn // 03.04.24

This cage match demo will feature a brief (and very friendly) overview of the most popular modern, open source, Python-only web development frameworks on the web: **Streamlit** and **Plotly Dash.**

We also will touch on the following technologies / libraries:

- GitHub (cloud-based code repository)
- VS Code (integrated development environment)
- Plotly (charting library)
- PyDeck (mapping library)
- Pandas (data wrangling)
- Geopandas (geospatial data wrangling)

If following along, make sure to install the following dependencies in your virtual environment (or system wide):

- `pip install streamlit`
- `pip install dash`
- `pip install plotly`
- `conda install pydeck`
- `conda install geopandas`

To run the `streamlit_demo.py` app, run the following command in your terminal: `streamlit run streamlit_demo.py`.

To run the `plotly_dash_demo.py` app, run the following comman: `python plotly_dash_demo_py`.
